Tokenization means splitting the wordds into tokens and these tokens can be divided by using the tiktoken 
in general after giving the input tha words will be turned into the tokens by tokinezer then the divided tokinzer

## Interview questions

What is tokenization?
Tokenization is the process of converting input text into smaller pieces called tokens. 
then Each token is assigned a numerical token ID according to the tokenizer's vocabulary.
The model cannot understand raw text directly, so tokenization is the first step before the text is processed by the neural network.

Input
I love AI

Tokens
["I", " love", " AI"]


Token IDs
[40, 3021, 15592]

Why do we need it?
we need this tokenization for converting the text into the tokens, coz the system cant understand the normal text like humans,
We need tokenization because language models cannot directly process raw text such as words or sentences. They operate on numerical inputs. 
Tokenization converts text into tokens and token IDs, which can then be processed by the model.


How does tiktoken work?
it splits the text into tokens some kind of library like tiktoken

chatgpt - tiktoken is a Python library provided by OpenAI that implements the same tokenizer used by certain OpenAI models.
It converts text into tokens and token IDs, and it can also decode token IDs back into text.


Why can't an LLM understand plain text directly?
Not only LLM computer itself wont understand the plain text so the text has to be converted into the tokens so the llm can understand the content based 
on the vocablary it is trained on 

chatgpt - A language model performs mathematical operations on numbers, not on characters or words directly. 
Therefore, the text must first be converted into numerical token IDs before the model can process it.

What does tiktoken do?
it is a kind of library, it converts the text into the tokens for the llm to understand it 

Are tokens always words?
No, a single word can be coverted into the multiple tokens 
ex:
internationalization
it is a single word but it becomes serveral tokens 


Are token IDs random?
no, every model has there ow n library and for each model only once the library can be created and it cannot be changed once it created

















Things I misunderstood at first

For tokenization, yours might be:

❌ I thought token IDs change.
✅ They are fixed within a tokenizer.
❌ I thought the model understands binary directly.
✅ The model processes numerical token IDs and embeddings.
❌ I thought tokenization included embeddings.
✅ Embeddings are the next stage after tokenization.
